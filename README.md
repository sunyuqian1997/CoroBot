# CoroBot
A chatbot trained on COVID-19 related tweets and reddit posts by Yuqian Sun

This project aims to provide a way to communicate with the illusioinal, unfamiliar creature and reflect on our own. Can we build a persuasive, believable persona through people’s comments and thoughts towards it? Even when this "person" is not exist? And, could we regard machine learning as modern witchcraft?
